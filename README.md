# Optimization-of-the-Curve-of-Quickest-Descent-with-Friction-and-Air-Resistance
This repository explores the optimization of the curve of quickest descent under conditions of friction and air resistance. The approach leverages Python, TensorFlow, and Bayesian optimization to find the optimal path.
